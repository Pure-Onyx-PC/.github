# PURE ONYX

**PURE ONYX** is a classic beat 'em up with RPG elements set in the world of our flagship title, **Malise and the Machine**.  

It follows heroine **Onyx** as she brawls her way through the dystopian streets of **New Babylon**, where she’ll encounter gangs, crime syndicates, a corrupt police force, and the bio-engineered horrors of the insidious **Babel Corporation**.  

It features fully animated, 3D art and is styled after 80s cyberpunk anime.  
**PURE ONYX** contains in-game, fully animated H content.
